# Employee-Class-problem-3.14
Follow the directions for problem 3.14 in your textbook.
To give the employee a raise you should include a giveRaise() method 
that increases the value of the salary instance variable by 10%.
If your method does not actually change the value of the instance variable
it is not correct.
